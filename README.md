Work in progress. This repository only includes the 3D files and some images at the moment!

Added some parts to build a cheaper version:

# About the G-EDM

    The G-EDM is a multi axis electrical discharge CNC machine that enables you to cut any kind of steel with just some electricity and water.
    EDM uses tiny electrical discharges to cut conductive materials and is a silent and precise way to create all kinds of shapes out of almost any kind of metal.

# The G-EDM

This picture is not up-to-date. A lot has changed. The variable 30v bench PSU is not needed anymore and has been replaced by a 12v PSU that is mounted within the spark generator. This build can be used as single axis sinker/drill EDM but also as multiaxis CNC. Both is possible.

The old controlpanel has been replaced by a nice looking one with better cable management.
