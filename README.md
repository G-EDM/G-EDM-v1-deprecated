# About the G-EDM

    The G-EDM is a multi axis electrical discharge CNC machine that enables you to cut any kind of steel with just some electricity and water.
    EDM uses tiny electrical discharges to cut conductive materials and is a silent and precise way to create all kinds of shapes out of almost any kind of metal.

# WARNING

An activated carbon airfilter is highly recommended. The spark of EDM can evaporate metals and may create some amount of metal fumes. 
It is also recommended to use gloves to handle the dirty water. If a waterfilter is used it may be a good advice to not open it after it fully dried out due to the super tiny metal particles created by EDM.

G-EDMs health tip: Don't smoke or drink metal.

This picture is not up-to-date. A lot has changed. The variable 30v bench PSU is not needed anymore and has been replaced by a 12v PSU that is mounted within the spark generator. This build can be used as single axis sinker/drill EDM but also as multiaxis CNC. Both is possible.

The old controlpanel has been replaced by a nice looking one with better cable management.
