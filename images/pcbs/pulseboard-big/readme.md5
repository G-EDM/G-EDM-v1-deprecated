# Important

    A heatsink is required. The pictures don't show a heatsink since I didn't had one at the time the pictures where made.
    The Mosfets can be mounted upright too. This alows to use more types of heatsinks.
    Check the pictures before soldering them to ensure they are mounted in the correct direction.
    
    If a single heatsink is used the Mosfets need insulation. 
    If a screw is used to mount them to a heatsink washers are needed to prevent the screw from touching the casing of the Mosfets.
