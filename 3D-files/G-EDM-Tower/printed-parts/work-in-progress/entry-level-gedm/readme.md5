# About the entry level G-EDM

    This version is supposed to be a budget entry level EDM machine
    At the moment this is only a 1 axis sinker/drill EDM 
    
    
# Changelog

    Instead of a large 120x80 Extrusion it uses a small and cheap 4040 extrusion as backbone
    It also uses a cheap 15180 extrusion as base plate instead of the 160x40 extrusion.
    Only a few parts have changed. There are some images in the image folder and those new parts are highlighted orange.
