This jig can be used to drill 12mm round bars like axles or the shafts of C12-ER16 collet chucks to use them with internal waterflow.

The reamer chuck can be sued to enlarge the bore. In reamer mode the water flows from the bottom through the pilot hole while z moves up and down.

For deep holes the normal brass tubes won't work very good if the inner diameter is too small. There are special EDM tubes available that have multiple tubes pressed into a normal tube. This prevents a long tiny metal spike that builds up with normal tubes and cloggs it at some point.

The deeper the hole is the better the pump should be. Low flow is ok if it has enough pressure. For my purposes the 12v peristaltic pump works. A second one in series would produce more pressure.


Aluminumtubes are not precision parts. My 40mm OD x 32mm ID tubes are 40mm x 32.1mm. So I needed oversized parts. The parts are named. Choose the size that fits your need.


Add some gluestick or strong hairspray to the printer bed for the big pipe stand and a 20mm brim. Without it will wrap heavily 100%.
