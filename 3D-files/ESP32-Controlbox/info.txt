The big enclosure body was printed with PLA+ flipped 90Â° to the left with the biggest brim possible and some large antiwarping patches. Hairspray on the bed helps alot.

Printed with zero supports. The displaywindow was just bridged. No problems.


The top lid can be printed with the text down and again without supports.
