Step down converter to control voltage and current:

  /** 
    *
    * If money is no issue I recommend the bigger one. 
    * I use the small one that can deliver a maximum of 5A which I'm happy with
    *

PLA+ and a little TPU for a small belt.


My drill chuck is a big ballbearing with a 12mm OD 10mm ID steel tube pressed into the bearing and a small dremel like chuck with 10mm OD pressed into the tube.
The ball bearing has 12mm ID and 32mm OD. 10mm height. It is pressed into the tool head. A little glue would be good but I just pressed it in.



4x 684ZZ Ball bearings for the printed idler pulley
2m GT2 Timing belt. 6mm width. Use a set that comes with the aluminum clamp mount block/bar that is needed.

Aluminum extrusions:

Base plate:
160x40 Slot 8; 400mm length; Heavy or Eco variant; M8 Thread on one side in the two center holes;

Z axis:
1x 120x80 Slot 8mm; 750mm length; Heavy or Eco variant;
1x 20x40 Slot 6mm; 400mm - 600mm length; For more worktravel use 600mm;

Linear rails:

Z-Axis:
HGR15 with 1 slliding block, Same length as the small extrusion; 400mm -600mm;


Mounting parts:

The big Z Beam rests on the base plate and is connected with two angle brackets and a aluminum plate at the back.

2x 40x40 90° brackets for Slot 8 profiles
1x 150x80x10 Aluminum plate

Some T-Nuts for Slot 8 and 6 slots:

20x Slot-8 M8
20x Slot-6 M6
Slot-6 M3 (number depends on the length of the linear rail)



A package of setscrews and a box of different hex screws. M2, M3, M4. Also some M6 and M8 Screws are needed.
T Slots Nuts for M6, M8, M4. I don't use the small ones. Only the heavy squaretype ones.


M8 and M6 screws. Don't know the exact size
M8
4x M8x18 
6x M8x25
6x M8x30
M6
12x M6x15

M3
M3x8 ( number of screws depends on the linear rail length you choose )

 
Stepper:

Z-Axis:
Nema 17; 0.4Nm; 1.68A; 1.8° Step angle; 5mm shaft; Rated 2.8v (This is important! No 12v or 24v rated steppers. The steppers shares the PSU with other stuff that can't handle more than 12v.)
Nema 17 planetary gearbox; 19.2:1; 8mm shaft; ( if you can't get the exact 19,2:1 gear ratio you can use 19:1 or similar; This can be adjusted in the software)

For the strong roundbar drill jig an aluminum tube is needed with 40mm OD and 32mm ID. Currently only supports 12mm round bars.


This list may not be complete. Some screws and maybe other parts needed could be missing here.
