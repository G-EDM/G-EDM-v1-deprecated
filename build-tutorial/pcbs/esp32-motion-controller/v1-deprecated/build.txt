# capacitors

    C2, C3, C6 = 100nF 50v ceramic disc capacitor
    C8         = 680uf 25v capacitor
    C5         = 47uf 63v capacitor ( this can be a 680uf 16v capacitor too, I just used what I had around at that time. )
    C7         = 680uf 16v capacitor
    
    
# Resistors

    R3, R5 = 1kOhm   1/2W resistor
    R2, R4 = 100kOhm 1/2W resistor


# Dip switches

    SW1 = 4 pole dip switch
    
    
# Pin headers

    J1, J2, J4, J9, J10, J11, J12, J13 = Pin headers ( can be cut to size )
    
    
# Pin sockets

    J5, J6, U1, U2, U3, U4 = Pin sockets ( don't solder the ESP or TMC directly on the PCB! )
    
    
    
# Screw Terminals

    J7, J8, J15, J17 = 4 pole screw terminal
    J18              = 2 pole screw terminal
