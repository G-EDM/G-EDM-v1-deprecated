# Important

    Only one GND wire is connected from the ESP32 motion controller to the pulseboard. 
    It doesn't matter if the PWM ( IN / GND ) is used or the vSense GND.
    If both GND wires are connected to the pulseboard it creates a ground loop that produces
    a large amount of EM noise that renders the feedback useless and the machine won't work.
    
    
    
    I wired the PWM OUT to the pulseboards PWM IN and PWM GND to the pulseboard PWM GND.
    The vSense IN to the pulseboard vSense OUT. The vSense GND is unconnected on both boards!
