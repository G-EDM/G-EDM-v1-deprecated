# V2 vs V1

The first prototype (V1) and the new board have only minor changes. V2 exposes more Pins to the user, but they are not used yet.

The biggest change is the Z axis microstepping. Z microstepping on the V2 board is now set via jumpers while with V1 the Z microsteps where set via software and GPIOs.

Also unused capacitors and pulldown resistors where removed. 

The pinout of the boards pin headers remains the same. The internal software pinout has a minor change to one single Pin. The DIR Pin of the spindle motor has changed. But that is managed by the software.


# Important

    Only one GND wire is connected from the ESP32 motion controller to the pulseboard. 
    It doesn't matter if the PWM ( IN / GND ) is used or the vSense GND.
    If both GND wires are connected to the pulseboard it creates a ground loop that produces
    a large amount of EM noise that renders the feedback useless and the machine won't work.
    
    
    
    I wired the PWM OUT to the pulseboards PWM IN and PWM GND to the pulseboard PWM GND.
    The vSense IN to the pulseboard vSense OUT. The vSense GND is unconnected on both boards!
