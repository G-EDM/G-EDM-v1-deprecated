# Important warning

The trim poti is used to adjust the feedback voltage that goes to the ESP. There is no protection! If the trim poti is not set correct before the feedback is connected to the ESP32 is may deliver voltages that will destroy the ESP.

Before connecting the ESP the trim poti needs to be set. Counter clockwise will reduce the voltage, while clockwise will increase the voltage. The output should be 2.8v at the highest voltage used. If a 60v PSU is used it should output 2.8v@60v. If 110v is used it should output 2.8v@110v.

If no multimeter is available it is possible to use a LED to test it. Rotate the trim poti counter clockwise for multiple turns. Connect the LEDs positive leg to the vSense output and the negative to the unused gnd next to it in the same terminal.

Then power up the spark PSU at the max voltage. There should now be a tiny voltage on the LED but not enough to make the LED glow. Rotate the poti clockwise until the LED starts glowing slightly. Now it is safe to connect the ESP. After the ESP is connected the feedback voltage is visible on the display and can then be fine tuned to match 2.8v.
