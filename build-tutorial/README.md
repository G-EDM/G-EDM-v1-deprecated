# About the partlists

    The GEDM-Tower partlist may not be complete and may miss some parts. It is a work in progress. 
    
    
# Some build tips

    Whenever possible it is adviced to re-melt critical position on the parts. This machine is meant to be strong and some screws are very tight. To prevent layer separation under high torque at least the holes should be remelted.
    
    I use a normal lighter to do this and just burn the position until it starts to get glassy. For holes it doesn't matter if it starts to burn for a short time.
    
    This increases the strength heavily!
    
    If a normal lighter is used and the part is not black be careful to use the blue part of the flame. The red/orange part will produce black spots.
