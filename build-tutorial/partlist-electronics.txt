# Requirements

Don't bother with 30W soldering irons. The board uses power and gnd planes without thermal reliefs. The connections between the legs and the planes are fully filled and the heat applied will spread rapidly across the planes. A 30W soldering iron will not be able to keep up with this. It can be done somehow but I don't recommend it.


I use this soldering iron with the ~3mm single flat tip at full power and it works well. The small tips again won't do it for connections to the gnd plane:

# Tools and useful parts


* Tools

    - 1x A cheap Multimeter
    https://www.amazon.com/Neiko-40508-Digital-Multimeter/dp/B00066ZZO4
	- 1x 60W soldering Iron
	https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Ceramic-Adjustable-Temperature-Repairing/dp/B09DSDBC7G
	- 1x solder wire
	- 1x set shrinking tube
	- 1x set wire end ferrules with crimp tool

# Parts needed for spark generator


* Case

    - Metal case; I use a 19" 3U ( 440 x 290 x 132 mm ) rack mount server case
    It needs to be metal to shield the EMI noise and offer enough room to add one or two fans for good ventilation.


* Power supplies

    - 1x 65V 12.3A 800W LED Switch Power Supply
    https://www.amazon.com/NVVV-Transformer-Security-Printer-Computer/dp/B09L4JBKPV


    - DPM-8605 60V 5A step down module ( to control voltage and amps of the PSU )
    https://www.amazon.com/DPM-8605-485-Programmable-Communication-Step-Down-Converter/dp/B0BC8PHF2Z

    - 12V 10A PSU ( to provide the power for the steppers and the pulseboard )
    https://www.amazon.com/LEDMO-Switching-Converter-Adapter-Transformer/dp/B01E6RMASC

    - A power plug with 3 Wires ( Hot/Neutral/Ground )
    Choose the biggest wire possible. 14 AWG should be fine for this build. If possible 12 AWG.
    It will deliver power to both PSUs. The 12v and the 65v. The DPM limits the 65V PSU to 5Amps. The steppers run at about 1.5A each depending on the microsteps. 

    - 2 banana jacks ( one red one black )
    Not all of them are isolated. If they're not isolated they cannot be mounted directly onto the metal case and need a printed mounting plate as isolation from the box.
    https://www.amazon.com/Banana-Female-Binding-Adapter-Connectors/dp/B07C7WG23G

    - Aligator clips with banana plugs on one side; 15A
    https://www.amazon.com/Banana-Crocodile-Alligator-Probe-1000V/dp/B083DN3RQL


* Misc

    - 4x bass hex standoffs ( to mount the raw DPM8605 PCB; can be 5-20mm )
    - 4x brass hex standoffs ( Lenght depends on the size of the heatsink )
    https://www.amazon.com/XLX-Male-Female-Female-Female-Assortment-Stainless/dp/B07ZSYDGR6


# Parts needed for the control panel


* Display

    - 1x ILI9341 Touch 2.4" 240x320 ( There are many different version. Some are large in size even if the display is 2.4" and some don't have touch)
    https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Display-ILI9341-Touch-240x320/dp/B07WNLNRDN


* Wires

    - A set jumper wires 20cm female-to-female ( To connect the display to the PCB )
    - A set jumper wires 20cm male-to-female ( To connect the switches, vSense, PWM )
    - AWG21 or 0.75mm wire ( to connect the stepper motors to the terminals )
    - AWG16 or 1.5mm ( to connect the 12v motor power from the spark generator to the control panel )


 + Connectors

    - 7x 4-Pin GX16 aviation sockets and plugs

    Best to buy a pack of 10 or two packs of 5:
    https://www.amazon.com/Yowming-Aviation-Thread-Female-Connector/dp/B07HT76HG6

    - 1x Set DC connectors and sockets ( used for the limit switches )
    https://www.amazon.com/Socket-Threaded-Connector-Adapter-Dustproof/dp/B08SJM2G52

    - Some 2 port WAGO connectors

##
## Note: There are two version of the pulseboard available. They both work different
## The small one has the mosfets separated and uses a DIP8 gate driver to switch them
## The big version uses a discrete push/pull gate driver circuit based on bjt power transistors
## and supports up to 6 mosfets integrated on the PCB. It also has some indicator LEDs.
## The total costs of the parts are nearly the same except for the PCBs itself. The big PCB is roughly double the price due to double the size
## I think the big one is easier to build and the LEDs just look cool.

* Heatsink

    - 1x Heatsink that covers all 6 mosfets. 140mm lenght would be perfect but couldn't find any. 130mm could work too but it would make the outer mosfets sitting on the total edges of the heatsink. Don't like it.
    https://www.amazon.com/LuoQiuFa-Aluminium-Heatsink-Radiator-Computer/dp/B0B1CDPJDT 

    ( I haven't mounted any heatsink at the moment. Need to get one first too. For short testing with 1A this is ok but only for short testings. The mosfets get hot very fast and and at some point: Problem. )

* Capacitors

## Parts needed for the ESP32 controller PCB
##
###############################################################

* External boards

    - 1x ESP32 38Pin WROOM-32 NodeMCU
    https://www.amazon.com/DORHEA-Development-Microcontroller-NodeMCU-32S-ESP-WROOM-32/dp/B08MQDS6WV
    - 4x TMC2209 v2.0 ( For the sinker only build 2 of them will do. 1 for Z and 1 for the spindle )
    Note: Those drivers are originally designed by watterott and called SilentStepStick
    They shared the design with the opensource community and now a lot of clones are sold on Amazon.
    If you want to support them for their great drivers buy the original boards:
    https://github.com/watterott/SilentStepStick
    https://shop.watterott.com/SilentStepStick-TMC2209-V2

    It is important to use the v2.0 version of those drivers. They have a better chip and a bigger heatsink (14,5 x 15 x 13). They are able to handle more current. And a small warning: They are supper sensitive and can be damaged easily. Never move the stepper by hand while the drivers are connected. The reverse voltage can damage the drivers.


+ Screw terminals

	- 1x 2 pole terminal 5mm grid ( for 12v power )
	- 4x 4 pole terminal 5mm grid ( to connect the steppers. One for each axis )

* Pin sockets

	- 2x 1x19 Pin Sockets ( to plug in the ESP32 )
	- 8x 1x8  Pin Sockets ( to plug in the TMC2209 drivers )

    These sets will work. They don't have the exact pin number needed but it is possible to cut them to size:
    https://www.amazon.com/Glarks-Straight-Connector-Assortment-Prototype/dp/B076GZXW3Z


* Pin headers

	- 1x 1x11 Pin Header
	- 6x 1x2  Pin Header
	- 1x 2x2  Pin Header ( this one is a two row header 2x2 pins. It is possible to use 2 1x2 headers too )

    These will work for the single row pin headers and can be cut to size:
    https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-20pcs-2-54mm-Single-Header/dp/B07R5QDL8D


    Note: In the example images there where pin sockets used instead of pin headers. It works too but is not recommended. The jumper wire pins won't hold very tight in these sockets.


* Capacitors

	- 1x 680uf 25v capacitor 8mm diameter; 5mm grid
	- 1x 680uf 16v capacitor 8mm diameter; 5mm grid
	- 1x 47uf 63v capacitor <= 8mm diameter; 5mm grid; ( this one can be 16v too. I had them and used them. )
	- 3x 100nF 50v ceramic disc capacitor


* Resistors

	- 2x 1k   1/2W resistor
	- 2x 100k 1/2W resistor ( Buy 3 of them. Maybe one is used later for the vSense input pin )
	( The build images show larger resistors but they are heavily oversized )


* Dip switch

	- 1x 4 pole dip switch ( to set the microsteps for XY and A )

	https://www.amazon.com/Comidox-Position-Switch-Module-Terminals/dp/B07LBMC9HV


* Diode

    - 1x 1N4001 diode or similar. ( For the 12v Fan output. Not tested yet. )
