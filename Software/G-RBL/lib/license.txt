The gedm folder is copyright protected and not allowed to be used in any commercial ways and redistribution without permission is prohibited.


The grbl_esp32 folder is a highly modified version of grbl_esp32 and complies with the licensing they set.


The GEDM code is not a commercial product and is not sold, nor is it a ready to use product or compiled binary. It is not shipped with another product in any way. The code is not used in any GEDM products that may become available. It is just a beautiful poem on github that everyone can read and have fun with.

All those points make it possible that the license of grbl doesn't affect the GEDM folder. 

The code is for private use and research only and not meant to be compiled. If it compiles at all.
