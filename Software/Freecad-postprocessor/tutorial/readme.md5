# This is just one way to create a 2D GCode
# It may not be the best or correct way
# but it creates gcode. It is pretty sure not the correct way to do it!
#
# I'm a noob and there are for sure better ways to do it 
# Normally some stock material is used too etc.

I'm not sure if the fontfile is needed after the shape was created.
If there is no text visible just click on shapestring in the left treeview and change the entry "Font File" to whatever .ttf you have available and press enter.


### Add the postprocessor ###

Put the file "edm_grbl_post.py" into the folder used for the macros. On my linux machine the folder is: "/home/your-username/.local/share/FreeCAD/Macro/"
Now open freecad and go to "edit->preferences" and click on the "path" icon. The click the tab "job preferences"
In the section Defaults add the path to the Macro folder in the "Path" field and confirm with "apply"
Freecad may need a restart after this.


### Create a 2D textshape ###

1. Open the Draft Workbench
2. Click the "S" to create a shape from text
3. Insert the text string in the left menu, set the fontsize and select a font. I used moonhouse from dafont.com

### create the electrode tool. This is only done once and remains available in the future. ###

1. click the toolbit dock icon in the workbench tool panel at the top. It looks like three drills.

2. select job->stock in the left treeview with a single click
